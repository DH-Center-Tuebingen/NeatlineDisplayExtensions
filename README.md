#Neatline Display Extensions

This is a plugin for [Omeka](http://omeka.org/), which adds some features to and modifies some styles in [Neatline](http://neatline.org/), e.g.:
* Waypoint item content can be loaded from external file via JavaScript
* Waypoint item display enhanced with Fancybox
* Neatline timeline and waypoints style adaptations

Installation:
* Copy sources to `plugins/NeatlineDisplayExtensions` (alternatively, unzip the release Zip there)
* In the `views` folder, make symbolic links `admin` and `public` that point to `shared`
* Requires the [Neatline plugin](https://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/neatline/) to be installed

Runs in Omeka 2.3.1 and Neatline 2.5.1, should work with other 2.* versions of Omeka as well.
